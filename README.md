During my internship, I designed and developed a responsive landing page focused on web development. The project involved creating a user-friendly interface that adapts seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes. I implemented modern design principles and ensured optimal performance by utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The landing page features engaging visuals and clear calls to action, effectively showcasing the services offered and enhancing user experience. This experience sharpened my skills in responsive design and front-end development, preparing me for future projects in the field.
